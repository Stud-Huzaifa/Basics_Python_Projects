In this Student Grade Management System project, the following Python topics are covered:

1. Dictionaries
Usage: The student_grades dictionary stores student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values.
Concepts: Adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving data from a dictionary.
2. Functions
Usage: Functions like add_student, update_student, delete_student, and display_all_students are defined to perform specific tasks.
Concepts: Function definition, parameters, return values, and calling functions.
3. Conditional Statements (if-else)
Usage: Conditional statements are used to check if a student exists in the dictionary before updating or deleting, and to handle invalid user input.
Concepts: Decision-making using if, elif, and else statements.
4. Loops
Usage:
The while True loop is used to keep the main menu active until the user decides to exit.
A for loop is used in the display_all_students function to iterate through the dictionary and print each student's name and grade.
Concepts: Infinite loops, controlled loops, and iterating over dictionary items.
5. Input/Output
Usage:
The input() function is used to take user input for student names and grades.
The print() function provides feedback to the user about the actions taken (e.g., student added, updated, deleted).
Concepts: Reading input from the user and displaying output to the console.
6. Type Conversion
Usage: The input() function returns strings, so type conversion (e.g., int(input())) is used to convert user input into integers for grades.
Concepts: Converting data types (e.g., from string to integer).
7. Error Handling (Optional)
Usage: If implemented, error handling could be used to manage invalid input (e.g., entering a non-integer value for grades).
Concepts: Exception handling using try-except blocks (though not directly covered in the current code).
8. Modular Programming
Usage: Breaking down the code into separate functions for different tasks makes the program modular, easier to understand, and maintain.
Concepts: Organizing code into reusable and independent modules.
9. Program Flow Control
Usage: The program flow is controlled by the while True loop and conditional statements, guiding the user through the options and actions.
Concepts: Using loops and conditions to control the flow of the program.
10. Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts (Optional)
Usage: While not implemented in this code, OOP concepts like classes and objects could be introduced to represent each student as an object with attributes like name and grade.
Concepts: Classes, objects, methods (could be an expansion to the current project).
This project covers fundamental Python programming concepts that are essential for building more complex applications.
